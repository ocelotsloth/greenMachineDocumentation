### Change to Chain Mode

To change to chain mode, press the `GLOBAL AUXILIARY PAD` followed by the number
`46`. This will give you the following menu:

![Main Chain Menu](/path/to/chain/menu/screencap)

There are a couple different controls needed to change these settings.

- Forward/Backward
    - These keys move the blinking cursor on the screen. If you want to change
      a particular setting on the screen, first move to it so that it is blinking.
- Increment/Decrement
    - These keys actualy change the menu settings. If you are on a number, it will
      make that number go up or down. Otherwise it will change between applicable
      settings for that.

#### Chain Mode Menu Settings

There are a few different settings on the Chain menu:

- Chain Number
    - This number specifies which chain you are configuring.
- Step Number
    - There are multiple different steps on each chain. This number specifies
      which of these you are using.
- Setup
    - The setup number is the `User Kit` that the step of the chain is configured
      to be. Change this number to the number of the `User Kit` that you want to
      play on that step.
- Chain Mode Enable
    - This true/false value enables the chain mode. When set to false, you are
      in User Kit mode and will have to scroll through all of the different kits
      to get to the kit that you want.

#### To create a chain

To create a chain you simply need to select the chain number you want and then set
the `Setup` for each of the `Steps`.

When you reach the end of the chain that you wish to create, you can go to the end
of the normal User Kits and you will find a `Repeat` option, which will allow the 
chain to wrap over to the first item when you reach the end.

Also, if you wish to create a chain that is longer than the allowed length, you
can also have the chain jump to the next chain at the end. This allows for long
sets of songs to be created if needed.
